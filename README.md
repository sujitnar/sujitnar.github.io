## About 
##### I'm Sujit Narayanan and I recently graduated from Simon Fraser University with a PhD in theoretical condensed matter physics under the supervision of Prof. Malcolm P. Kennett. 
##### During my PhD I worked on fractional quantum Hall effect in single layer graphene (Check out the Research Tab for more info). Over the years I have worked on a variety of problems and acquired strong quantitative and numerical techniques which I am eager to apply to real world problems.
