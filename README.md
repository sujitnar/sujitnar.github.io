## About 
##### I'm Sujit Narayanan and I recently graduated from Simon Fraser University with a PhD in theoretical condensed matter physics under the supervision of Prof. Malcolm P. Kennett. During my PhD I worked on fractional quantum Hall effect in single layer graphene (Check out the Research Tab for more info).


##### Over the years I have developed a broad set of interests and I have worked on a vareity of different problems ranging from the small scales (studying transport porperties in cells) to medium scales ( Ising spin chains using monte carlo simulation, quantum Hall effect) to large (Information Paradox in Black Holes).
